# Useless code
## What?
This is a mono repo, that represents a pile of literally useless code. They're doing a simple task, but in a very 
unusual and inefficient way.  

## But... why?  
Writing bad code on purpose teaches me a lot! Because I know, I'm implementing garbage and can come up with better ways. 
It's like a sandbox, where I'm trying some stuff and maybe something useful emerges out of it.  

## Disclaimer
It is obvious, but **do not use this code for production**. You can use some snippets or parts, but only if you're 
100% confident about the stuff you want to use.

## Issues
Lol, if you're filing issues or bugs, you're trolling.  

## Dependencies
All code inside this mono repo doesn't use 3rd party dependencies. So you can run any Python version above 3.10!  

## Contribution
If you want to add some useless code, feel free to open a PR. But don't cross-reference through the projects inside
this repo. Every project should run isolated from other projects. 
Chaos inside the projects is okay, but not between them.
